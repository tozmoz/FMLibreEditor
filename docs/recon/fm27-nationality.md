# FM27: secondary nationalities and homegrown status

Notes behind editing a player's secondary nationalities and homegrown status. They were read
from the Mac Steam build, on the July 2026 save, against the game's own eligibility page
(**Personal › Nationality Information** and **Nation / Club Eligibility**), which the
maintainer shared for Kenan Yıldız, Jamal Musiala and Achraf Hakimi.

## The list of relations

A player's first nationality is his `nation` pointer. Everything else lives in one list: the
person's relations. The pointer at `+0x2C0` in the player object (macOS; in the person block,
`+0x300` on Windows by the usual 0x40) leads to a record that starts with a list
`(begin, end, capacity)` of 16-byte entries:

| Offset | Field |
| --- | --- |
| `+0x00` | pointer to the target: a nation, club, person or competition |
| `+0x08` | `u16`, a count some relations use |
| `+0x0A` | `u8`, the kind of target: 1 a club, 3 a person, 7 a competition, 8 a nation |
| `+0x0B` | `u8`, the kind of relation |
| `+0x0C` | `u8`, a value: a strength, or a homegrown rule |
| `+0x0D` | `u8`, a second level |
| `+0x0F` | always `0xFF` |

The relations that matter here:

| Relation | Target | Value | The game shows |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 9 | nation | 100, then 80 | a secondary nationality |
| 70 | nation | the rule | Nation Eligibility: trained in the nation |
| 72 | club | the rule | Club Eligibility: trained at the club |

The others include favoured clubs (3), disliked clubs (4), people (1, 2) and time spent in a
nation (124).

Homegrown rules, by the game's code, as the eligibility page names them:

| Code | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Homegrown 15-21 |
| 2 | Homegrown 0-21 |
| 5 | Homegrown 15-21 (excluding loans) |
| 10 | Homegrown 0-19 (1 year) |

Codes 3, 6, 7, 8, 11 and 12 occur too; their names are not known yet. The page's
**Nationality Eligibility** (for example "Italy, 4 Years In Nation") is not stored: the game
works it out.

Checked against the page:
- Yıldız: Germany (9), Germany and Italy (70, rule 1), FC Bayern and Juventus (72, rule 1),
  Juventus again with rule 5.
- Musiala: England and Nigeria (9), Germany (70, rule 1), England (70, rule 2), Chelsea (72,
  rules 2 and 10), FC Bayern (72, rule 1).
- Hakimi: Spain (9 and 70), Real Madrid (72).

## Room

Out of a sample of 3,636 lists, 94% were exactly as long as their capacity, and most held
1 to 8 entries. Their blocks are too small for the allocator's known size classes, so an entry
can seldom be added without allocating, which the editor never does. Changing or removing an
entry always works.

## Checked in the game

With the probe holding the changes (`tie-set` and `tie-add` with `--hold`), the game's page
showed each at once:
- Yıldız's secondary nationality changed from Germany to England;
- Türkiye added to Musiala's, as a third secondary nationality;
- Hakimi's training changed from Spain, 15-21 to England, 0-21.

On the Windows Steam and Game Pass builds the record is at `+0x300` in the player, 0x40 further than on macOS
like the rest of the person, and the entries are laid out alike: Yıldız, Musiala and Hakimi read
exactly as above. A changed, an added and a removed entry were each restored with the probe and
undone in the app, on both builds.

Not yet checked: what a competition's homegrown rules make of a changed entry over a game day.

## Also seen

- `+0x2C8` points at the player's city of birth, whose nation is at `+0x20` (Regensburg,
  Germany for Yıldız).
- The international data at `+0x118` (`INTERNATIONAL_PLAYER_DATA`) lists the other national
  teams a player has played for: Victor Moses, England; Mateo Retegui, Argentina.
- FM27 keeps a person's appearance as the match engine's 3D face values
  (`MATCH_PERSON_APPEARANCE_INPUT`), not as a few fields.
