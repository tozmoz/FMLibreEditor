# Installing FMLibreEditor

FMLibreEditor is a free program that edits the players, staff and clubs of Football Manager
27 while the game runs. It works on Windows with the Xbox / Game Pass and Steam builds, and
on macOS with the Steam build.

**Before you start, save your game under a new name in FM.**

## Windows

1. Download
   [FMLibreEditor-Setup.exe](https://github.com/tozmoz/FMLibreEditor/releases/latest/download/FMLibreEditor-Setup.exe)
   and run it.
2. If Windows says "Windows protected your PC", click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.
   The program is not signed yet.
3. Pick a language, then click **Next** and **Install**. No administrator rights are needed.

To use it without installing, download the
[portable zip](https://github.com/tozmoz/FMLibreEditor/releases/latest/download/FMLibreEditor-portable.zip),
extract it and run **FMLibreEditor.exe**.

## macOS

1. Download
   [FMLibreEditor-macOS.zip](https://github.com/tozmoz/FMLibreEditor/releases/latest/download/FMLibreEditor-macOS.zip),
   open it and move **FMLibreEditor** to **Applications**.
2. Open it. The app is signed and notarized by Apple, so macOS opens it without a warning.
3. Quit Steam (**Steam › Quit Steam**), then click **Set up the bridge** in FMLibreEditor.
   This lets FM27 share its memory with the app when Steam starts it. System Integrity
   Protection stays on.

## Using it

1. Start FM27 (on macOS, from Steam) and load a save. The main menu is not enough.
2. Open FMLibreEditor and click **Connect**.
3. Open a player, a member of staff or a club, click **Edit**, change values and click
   **Apply**.

The game shows a change after you press **Continue** in FM. The **Changes** view lists what
you did, and **Undo** puts the old value back.

## Updating and removing

When a new version is out, FMLibreEditor says so at the top of its window when it starts;
**Download** opens its page. **Check for updates**, at the foot of the window, asks again. To
check, the app asks GitHub for the latest release; it sends nothing else.

- **Windows:** run the new installer over the old one. To remove it, go to Settings › Apps.
- **macOS:** put the new app in Applications in place of the old one. To remove it, quit
  Steam, click **Remove the bridge**, then move the app to the Bin.

## If something goes wrong

- **It says FM27 is not running, or the player list was not found:** load a save and try
  again.
- **Windows: it opened read-only:** open it again; if that does not help, right-click it and
  choose **Run as administrator**.
- **Your antivirus flags it:** tools that read another program's memory are sometimes
  flagged by mistake. FMLibreEditor is open source; you can allow it in your antivirus.
- **macOS: it cannot get into the game:** quit FM27 and start it again from Steam.
