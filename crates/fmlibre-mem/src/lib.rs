//! Access to another process's memory on Windows and macOS.
//!
//! This crate knows nothing about Football Manager. It finds and opens
//! processes, lists their modules and memory regions, reads bytes and parses
//! module headers (PE on Windows, Mach-O on macOS) straight from the target's
//! memory. It writes only through [`Process::write_bytes`], on a process opened
//! for writing, and only into heap data: never into a module's code or data.
//!
//! macOS opens another process's memory only to a debugger, and only when the process
//! allows it, which the game does not. The game hands its memory over itself instead,
//! through the small library of `fmlibre-bridge` that it loads at start; [`bridge`] is
//! what the two sides say to each other.
