//! A club's youth intakes: the players the game made at its youth intakes who began their careers at the club, by the
//! day they joined it, and the cities people were born in, which a player's city of birth can be set to.
//!
//! The game marks a player it makes (at a youth intake, or as a youth candidate it lets go) with a flag in his
//! identity block (see [`PlayerLayout::made_by_game`]). It keeps no list of a club's intakes, but every player of one
//! joins the club on the intake's day, at 14 to 17, and has been trained at no other club. So a club's intake players
//! are the players it holds under contract (those it has lent out too) whom the game made, who joined it at 17 or
//! younger, and whose ties name no other club they were trained at: one the club bought from another club's intake has
//! a tie to that club. A player who joined from no club, as a youth candidate another club let go, counts too: he
//! began his career at the club. The game ties a player to his club as trained there some time after the intake, so
//! the newest intake's players have no tie yet. Where the layout does not place the flag, the club's players who
//! joined it young and were trained nowhere else are listed, the database's own among them.
//!
//! Only reads memory.
