//! A player's contract clauses and bonuses: changing what one pays or depends on, taking one out, and adding a
//! release clause.
//!
//! A contract lists them at `clauses` (see [`ContractLayout`]): 8-byte entries of a `u32` amount in pounds
//! (`0xFFFFFFFF` for none), a `u16` condition (`0xFFFF` for none: the goals, matches, years or percentage it depends
//! on, by kind) and a `u16` kind. The editor changes an amount or a condition an entry has, and never gives one to an
//! entry without; it takes an entry out, the ones after it moving up; and it adds a release clause to a contract
//! without one where the list's block has room. Like the other lists, it allocates nothing: most lists are as long as
//! the game made them, so a release clause can be added to few contracts.
//!
