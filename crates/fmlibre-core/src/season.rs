//! The season's statistics the game keeps for every player in every competition: appearances, minutes, goals and the
//! detailed counts behind its data hub (passes, duels, pressures, expected goals and more).
//!
//! The game keeps a `GAME_COMP_STATS` object for each competition it records statistics for, with a record for each
//! player who has played in it (see [`SeasonLayout`]). Nothing the editor reads otherwise points at them, so they are
//! found by their class (see `rtti.rs`), which takes a second or two: the app reads them all once, when they are first
//! asked for. The records name the player and the team he played for by the game's ids (`PlayerSummary::id`,
//! `TeamLayout::id`), and the competition holds the kind of season it is: a domestic league or cup, a continental
//! club competition, or one of national teams.
