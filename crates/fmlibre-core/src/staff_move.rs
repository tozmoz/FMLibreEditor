//! Moving a member of staff to another club, giving him another job at his club, signing one who has no club, and
//! releasing one from his club.
//!
//! A club keeps its staff in three department lists of pointers (see [`ClubLayout`]): the medical team, the coaches
//! and the scouts; a fitness coach may be in the first two. Its director of football is in none of them: the club
//! points at him itself, in its place for one (`director_of_football`), which most clubs leave empty. Its manager is
//! in none of them either: its senior team points at him, in its place for one (`manager` of [`TeamLayout`]), as a
//! youth or reserve team does at its own manager, who is one of the coaches too. A member of staff's contract points
//! at the team he works for and at the club's senior team.
//!
//! A move takes him out of every department list of his old club that holds him, out of its director of football's
//! place when it holds him, and out of a team's place for a manager when one holds him: that place is left empty, as
//! the game leaves it between two managers, for the club to fill. Keeping his job, he joins the same departments of
//! the new club, and its place for a director of football when he leaves one; given another job, or as a manager, he
//! joins where that job is (see [`STAFF_JOBS`]): a manager, the senior team's place. His contract points at the new
//! club's senior team, dated from today, with the job. A new job at his own club moves him between his club's
//! departments, or into or out of its places for a director of football and a manager, as the job needs. Those two
//! places take one only while they are empty: the editor does not put anyone out of his job, and never takes the
//! human manager's place.
//!
//! Signing a member of staff who has no club: like a free agent (see `signing.rs`), he gets a contract the editor makes
//! in a slot of the game's own pool of contracts, a copy of one of the club's own staff's contracts (see
//! [`Session::plan_staff_signing`]), and joins where his job is.
//!
//! Releasing a member of staff (see [`Session::plan_staff_release`]) takes him out of his club as a move does, and then
//! leaves him with no contract, as the game's own staff without a club are; the contract is left as it was, as only he
//! points at it. A contract's end moved to the game's date does not do it: on the Windows Steam build the game showed
//! the new end, and ended none of four such contracts in the six days it went on.
//!
//! A department list with no room for him in its block is grown into memory of the editor's own (see
//! `own_memory.rs`), where the editor can grow it (see `Session::growth`); elsewhere the move is refused. Only staff
//! whom neither the club nor its teams point at directly, other than in its places for a director of football and a
//! manager, are moved or given a new job; and only a director of football and a manager out of those places: someone
//! else there, a chairperson who runs a small club's team, is left to the game.
//!
//! The game keeps the contracts of some staff, most doctors and the board among them, as `db::BASIC_CONTRACT`: 40
//! bytes, as far as the job, with no dates. Only those first bytes of theirs are written.
//!
