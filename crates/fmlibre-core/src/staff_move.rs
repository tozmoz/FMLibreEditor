//! Moving a member of staff to another club, and giving him another job at his club.
//!
//! A club keeps its staff in three department lists of pointers (see [`ClubLayout`]): the medical team, the coaches
//! and the scouts; a fitness coach may be in the first two. A member of staff's contract points at the team he works
//! for and at the club's senior team. A move takes him out of every department list of his old club that holds him,
//! puts him in the same departments of the new club, and points his contract at its senior team, dated from today. A
//! new job changes his contract's job code, and moves him between his club's departments as the job needs.
//!
//! Like a player's move, it allocates nothing: a list must have room in the block it has. And only staff whom neither
//! the club nor its teams point at directly are moved or given a new job: a team's manager, for one, is held by his
//! team, and is left to the game.
//!
