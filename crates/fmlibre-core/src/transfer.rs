//! Moving a player to another club.
//!
//! Each team keeps a list of player pointers: the players under contract with it (those
//! out on loan too) and the players on loan to it. A player points at the team he plays
//! for, and his contract at the team that employs him. A move points both at the new
//! club's senior team, adds the player to that team's list and takes him out of his old
//! club's lists.
//!
//! The player goes into the senior team's list where its block has room: below its capacity,
//! or up to the end of the allocator's block (see [`HeapLayout`]). After a load every list is
//! full; a full list is then grown into memory of the editor's own, as the lists of ties are
//! (see `own_memory.rs`). Where the editor cannot grow it, a full list is no obstacle only when
//! one of the team's players is released in the same move: the player who joins takes his
//! slot, as in a swap (see [`Session::plan_club_move_releasing`]). Only players with simple
//! ties move: under contract with the club they play for (no loans), and not player-coaches.
//!
//! A free agent, who has no club and no contract, joins a club under a contract the editor makes
//! for him (see `signing.rs`).
//!
//! A player who leaves a club gives up the captaincies he holds in its teams: they are left
//! empty, as a youth team's often are, for the club to fill. One who leaves a club a human
//! manager runs also leaves his places in its selections empty, as he does when the game
//! moves him (see [`crate::selection`]); where the editor cannot find them, he is not moved.
//!
//! A release takes him out of his club's lists and leaves him with no team and no contract,
//! as the game's own free agents have. His contract is left as it was: nothing else in the
//! game points at it.
//!
//! Every write is a [`Patch`] holding the bytes it expects and the bytes it leaves, so a
//! move only lands on the memory it was planned from, and is only undone while the game
//! still holds what it wrote.
