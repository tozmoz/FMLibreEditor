//! Moving a player to another club.
//!
//! Each team keeps a list of player pointers: the players under contract with it (those
//! out on loan too) and the players on loan to it. A player points at the team he plays
//! for, and his contract at the team that employs him. A move points both at the new
//! club's senior team, adds the player to that team's list and takes him out of his old
//! club's lists.
//!
//! The editor allocates nothing in the game, so the senior team's list must have room in
//! the block it already has: below its capacity, or up to the end of the allocator's block
//! (see [`HeapLayout`]). Only players with simple ties move: under contract with the club
//! they play for (no loans), not player-coaches, and not at a club a human manager runs,
//! whose tactics, training and the like point at its players too.
//!
//! A player who leaves a club gives up the captaincies he holds in its teams: they are left
//! empty, as a youth team's often are, for the club to fill.
//!
//! A release takes him out of his club's lists and leaves him with no team and no contract,
//! as the game's own free agents have. His contract is left as it was: nothing else in the
//! game points at it.
//!
//! Every write is a [`Patch`] holding the bytes it expects and the bytes it leaves, so a
//! move only lands on the memory it was planned from, and is only undone while the game
//! still holds what it wrote.
