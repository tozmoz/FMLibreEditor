//! The retirements the game has planned, and keeping a player from retiring.
//!
//! The game decides ahead of time who retires and when, and keeps those plans in its retirement manager, one object
//! a static points at, which the build profile places ([`BuildProfile::retirement_manager`]). The manager lists them
//! twice: as pointers to the 24-byte entries, and as an index of the same entries sorted by person id. An entry names
//! the person by the id the game gives him (player `player_person`), not by a pointer, and holds the date he retires.
//!
//! Keeping a player from retiring takes his entry out of both lists, the way the game drops one, and gives him the
//! trait "Will play football as long as possible" in place of "Will retire at top". The entry itself stays where it
//! is, unlisted, and comes back with an undo.
