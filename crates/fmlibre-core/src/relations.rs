//! A player's ties to nations and clubs: his secondary nationalities, and the nations and clubs he was trained in,
//! which make him homegrown under a competition's rules.
//!
//! The game keeps a person's relations as one list, the first field of the record his `relations` pointer leads to
//! (see [`RelationLayout`]): 16-byte entries that each point at a nation, club, person or competition and say how he
//! is tied to it. A secondary nationality is a tie of kind 9 to a nation; a training is one of kind 70 to a nation or
//! 72 to a club, whose value is the homegrown rule it meets. His first nationality is not among them: it is the
//! player's `nation` field.
//!
//! The editor reads those three kinds of tie. It points one at another nation or club, gives a training another
//! rule, takes one out, or adds one. Like the squad lists, the list is as long as the game made it and the editor
//! allocates nothing: a tie is added only where the list's block has room (see [`HeapLayout`]), which most players'
//! lists lack, so changing one of his ties is the way to give him another.
//!
