//! Signing a free agent: a player with no club and no contract joins a club's senior team under a contract the editor
//! makes for him.
//!
//! The game's free agents have no team and no contract, and nothing but the game's list of players points at them. To
//! sign one, the editor takes a slot of the game's own pool of contracts as the game does when it makes one (see
//! `object_pool.rs`): the contract is then the game's like any other, saved with the others and let go of as they are.
//! It is a copy of the contract of the player of the club's senior team whose current ability is nearest his, among
//! those with a squad status fit for him (a goalkeeper's for a goalkeeper; for a player of 21 or more, no youngster's
//! and no youth contract), with:
//! - the player as its owner, and the senior team as his employer;
//! - the wage given, or the one it is modelled on;
//! - today as the day he signed and joined, and the end date given, or 30 June at the end of next season;
//! - no squad number, no loyalty bonus, and off the transfer and loan lists;
//! - none of the other's clauses, bonuses, reasons to be unhappy, or other records of its own
//!   ([`crate::ContractLayout::cleared`]).
//!
//! The kind of contract (full-time, part-time, ...), the squad status, how happy he is with it and the rest are the
//! other's. He then joins the senior team's list, grown when it is full (see [`Session::join_squad`]), and points at
//! the team and the contract. The undo takes all of it back, the slot first in the pool's chain again.
