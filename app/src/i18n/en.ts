// names of the fields), the Changes view `changes`, mass editing `massEdit`, comparing players `comparison`, moving a
// player to another club or swapping him with one `move`, a club's squad `squad`, the sidebar and the connect panel
// `app`, and the graphics packs the pictures come from `graphics`. The components read them through `labels.ts`.
//
// The text functions (counts, summaries, "was …") are written per language: plurals and word order differ, so a
