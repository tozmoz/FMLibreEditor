// Text of the player, staff and club profiles and lists, as the components import it. The wording is in i18n/en.ts,

// i18n/index.ts) under the names the components use. Keys of the game data map to the names FM uses; every other
// string of the panels is in `profileText` (those only the club panel has, in `clubProfileText`), and those of the
// player, staff and club lists in `playerListText`, `staffListText` and `clubListText`. Editing has `editText` (and
// `fieldLabel` for the names of the fields), the Changes view `changesText`, mass editing `massEditText`, comparing
// players `comparisonText`, moving a player to another club (or swapping him with one) `moveText`, releasing him
// `releaseText`, his nationalities and homegrown status `tieText`, a club's squad `squadText`, the sidebar and the connect panel `appText`, the status of the
// graphics packs `graphicsText`, and new versions of the app `updateText`.
// A new language only has to provide a dictionary of the same shape (and be added to i18n/index.ts, with a flag in
// LanguageSwitch.tsx).
